# me2ip

This is simply a project which outputs your IP address in either JSON or Plain Text, available through an API.

It also has a webpage which shows your IP and documents the API.

In production ([me2ip.xyz](https://me2ip.xyz)) the index.html, public.css and public.js files are cached by CloudFlare.

I haven't put any rate limits on it at the moment (as there isn't a need to).

Stats are available at [me2ip.xyz/stats](https://me2ip.xyz/stats).
